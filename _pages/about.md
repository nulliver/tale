Hi,

I'm a software engineer with experience mainly in Java and some Javascript too. I've been developing software for for the past sixteen years for the agriculture dealership industry and also enterprise resource management software. Outside office hours I like to play with different programming language, improve my software engineer skills and enjoy other hobbies like riding my bike, amateur astronomy and video games.

I live in Texas, USA with my lovely wife and our cat.

Thanks for visiting.
