title: Learning Rust
---
I just started to learn Rust.

I currently don't have any specific use in mind, I just like to learn it and Rust is a language that is in a different part of the spectrum from the one I'm used to.

It promises the speed of C and C++ without all their _vices_ so that sounds attractive, isn't?

I plan to document this journey on this blog.

So here's my first Rust program :)

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
