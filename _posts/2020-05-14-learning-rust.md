title: Learning Rust
---
I'm starting to learn Rust.

I currently don't have any specific use in mind for Rust, I just like to learn and Rust is a language that is in a different part of the spectrum from what I'm used to.

It promises the speed of C and C++ without all their _vices_ so that sounds attractive, isn't?

I plan to document my journey on this blog.

So here's my first Rust program :)

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
  println!("Hello, world!");
}
{% endhighlight %}
