I'm still learning the basic stuff of Rust. 

I'm using the offical book to learn Rust, the description of the book in the website at the moment is this:

Affectionately nicknamed “the book,” The Rust Programming Language will give you an overview of the language from first principles. You’ll build a few projects along the way, and by the end, you’ll have a solid grasp of the language.


It's a big book but so far I like it, it seems to be a mix of theory and practice which is great. You get a sense of the language as early as chapter two when you develop a simple guess game that demonstrate some of the language's concepts like immutability and error handling.

Chapter three seems to be the basics of the language which is similar to other language so it may be a quick read.
